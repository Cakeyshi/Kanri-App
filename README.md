This is a scheduler app I made for someone who needed it, I named it kanri (管理), japanese for "manage".
This repository includes all the source files and package configurations that is used in building the app as well as the link for the installer.
The technologies used in building this app are the following:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Jquery, Vanilla JS, and Electron-Forge

This project was also meant to improve my programming skills specifically in  web development and design.
